# combinatorial optimization project
Travelling salesman problem solved with use of Ant colony optimization. 
Code includes also greedy approach for the comparsion.
There is also file called findparams.py in which I tried to find best parameters for Ant colony with multiprocessing brute force approach.
File for drawing has to be adjusted manually (size of arrows) to work properly.
